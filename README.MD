# Maze Runner

Maze Runner is a project built using Python and Tkinter that generates a maze with a random seed. This seed creates the cells of the maze, which is then checked for solvability. It's an excellent practice for developing algorithmic skills. So far, I have implemented Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve the maze.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: Creates unique mazes each time using a random seed.
- **Solvability Check**: Ensures the generated maze can be solved.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**: Utilized to find a solution path through the maze.

## Installation

To get started with Maze Runner, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Jun707/maze_solver.git
    cd src
    ```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the application:

```sh
python3 main.py
